# Gitbook Page to PDF & PNG Converter

Hi, I'm **Mouad Zizi**, a Flutter & Full Stack Developer. You can find more about me at [mouadzizi.com](https://mouadzizi.com).  
I created this script because there is no straightforward way to download a Gitbook as a PDF unless you have a premium plan.

With this Node.js script, you can simply provide the URL of your Gitbook sitemap, and it will do all the work for you!  
The script will generate **PDFs** and **PNG images** for each page, organizing them in a structured directory format like this:

```
menu_data/
    intro/
    page1.png
    page1.pdf
    page2.png
    page2.pdf
another_menu/
    page3.png
    page3.pdf
    page4.png
    page4.pdf
```
